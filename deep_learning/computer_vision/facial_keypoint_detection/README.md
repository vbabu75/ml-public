# Facial Keypoint Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to identify keypoints in human faces. This is part of the Computer Vision Nanodegree program from Udacity. 

Steps to run the project:
1. To access the trained model, from the mlpublic-data repo, access the deep_learning/computer_vision/facial_keypoint_detection/saved_models.zip file. Unzip it as the saved_models subfolder here. 
2. Run the four Jupyter notebooks one by one.
