# Image captioning
This project implements a CNN Encoder and an RNN Decoder to build a image captioning system. This was part of the Computer Vision Udacity Nanodegree program.

Steps to run this project.
1. For the saved models, use the mlpublic-data repository /deep_learning/computer_vision/image_captioning/models.zip file. Unzip it to the models folder within this folder.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks one by one in the numbered order.
